    Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item weights, implement a function 
    `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds two items whose sum of weights equals
     the weight limit `limit`. Your function will return an instance of an `Answer` tuple that has the following form:
```
(zero, one)
```
where each element represents the item weights of the two packages. _**
The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_
 If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return `None`.

_NOTE:_ When calling `hash_table_retrieve` with a key that doesn't exist in the hash table, `hash_table_retrieve` will return `None`. 

Your solution should run in linear time.
